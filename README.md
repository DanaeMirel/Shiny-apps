# Shiny Apps

Exemples of my work building web applications and interactive  dashboards with Shiny 

1. **Alien App** - The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) has collected sightings data throughout the last century. 
This app allows users to select a U.S. state and a time period in which the sightings occurred.

2. **BMI App** - Sometimes you want to perform an action in response to an event. For example, you might want to display a 
notification or modal dialog, in response to a click.

The `observeEvent()` function allows you to achieve this. It accepts two arguments:
   - The event you want to respond to.
   - The function that should be called whenever the event occurs.
